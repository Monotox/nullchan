# Nullchan

P2P Imageboard engine for [ZeroNet](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet), featuring many of the features of centralized image boards, without the limitations. Currently uses optional files to reduce the number of images a user must cache. 

### Try it out

* on [ZeroNet itself](http://127.0.0.1:43110/0chan.bit) (if you have it installed and running)
* on [zero.pags.to](http://zero.pags.to:43110/0chan.bit) mirror
* on [bit.no.com](http://bit.no.com:43110/0chan.bit) mirror

### Set up your own board

First of all, you'll need to [RTFM](http://zeronet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using_zeronet/create_new_site/) and learn how to create new ZeroNet site. You also have to know  what [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is and how to use it.

Clone this repo in such a way that its contents are in your new site's root directory. Then run these commands in your site's root directory:

    $ npm install
    $ webpack --optimize-minimize

In root directory open file `content.example.json` and merge its contents with your file `content.json` generated by ZeroNet. You specificaly need to have keys `ignore` and `includes` set up just as they are in my file. 

Copy file `data/settings.example.json` to `data/settings.json`. Edit this new file `data/settings.json`, so it looks something like this: 

    {
      "siteName": "0chan", 
      "siteAddress": "0chan.bit", // either ZeroNet address or namecoin domain
                                  // i.e. "1FiSxj2yDPeGuuf6iBwRAXvEMQJATAZNt6" or "0chan.bit"
      "threadsPerPage": 15, // how much threads per one page you want to display
      "boards": [ 
        {
          "priority": 1, // priority in main page board list
          "key": "b", // short name for URLs
          "name": "Random stuff" // full name 
        }
      ]
    }

Copy file `data/users/user-content.example.json` to `data/users/content.json`, then go to ZeroNet root directory and run these commands:

    $ python zeronet.py siteSign YOUR_SITE_ADDRESS --inner_path data/users/content.json --publish
    $ python zeronet.py siteSign YOUR_SITE_ADDRESS --publish
